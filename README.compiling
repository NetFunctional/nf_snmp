Ensure you set the valid architectures on both the project and netfunctional_snmp target to 
armv6 and armv7.  Failure to do so will still build okay, but when you package your application
for the app store, it'll bitch because the armv6 portion of the library (libnetfunctionalsnmp.a) is 
missing, and only contains the armv7 and i386 portions.
